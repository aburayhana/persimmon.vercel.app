recipeinstructions:
- "Measure out your fresh jackfruit"
- "This is what it looks like, seeds have been removed prior to this."
- "Chop your jackfruit up, I just pulsed it in my food processor until it was about raisin sized. It was somewhere around 2 cups (give or take) like this."
- "Add the milk and jackfruit together, place on a pot on medium low heat to warm it (not cook) through and pull out some of the fruit flavor. About 10 minutes, Do not boil."
- "Mix all dry, ingredients together in a bowl, set aside."
- "Melt butter"

- "Oil spray your cooking pan of choice, and spoon the pudding into it."
- "Cover the pan with lid, or foil. Pudding mold, I use a Dutch oven with a spacer from my pressure cooker. If using a bundt pan, get a casserole or oven safe pan large enough to put your bundt pan in."
- "Add enough water to come up about 2/3 the way, or as much as the pan you are using safely allows."
- "If using the pudding mold, bring water to a simmer, cover Dutch oven. For the oven method, place in oven. It maybe safer to add water once it is in the oven."
- "Cook for 3 hours. Check water level every so often, add more if required."
- "Allow to cool, and remove lid"
- "If you had it in the refrigerator to cool, I submerge partially in warm water to warm the mold and loosen the pudding, and invert onto a plate."
- "Slice into smallish pieces, it&#39;s so dense and moist, this is just the way to do it. (trust me, big is not always better)"
- "Bare piece, before sauce or whipped cream"
