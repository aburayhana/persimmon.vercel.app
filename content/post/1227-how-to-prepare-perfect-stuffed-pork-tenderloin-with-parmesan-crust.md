recipeingredient:
- "1 pork tenderloin about 1 12 lbs"
- "10 oz or so of white mushrooms finely chopped"
- " Medium shallot finely chopped"
- "A few sprigs of fresh thyme"
- "1 cup or so of wilted spinach"
- " Lemon juice"
- "1 cup or so of plain breadcrumbs"
- "1/4 cup grated Parmesan cheese"
- "1 tbs Italian spices"
- " Olive oil"
- " Butter"
- "to taste Salt and pepper"
recipeinstructions:
- "Preheat the oven to 425F/220C."
- "Butterfly the tenderloin and pound it flat (use a meat hammer, rolling pin, your forehead, whatever works for you). Season with salt and pepper, then set aside."
- "Saute the mushrooms and shallots in butter along with the fresh thyme and season with salt and pepper. Cook on low until the mushrooms and shallots are soft, dark, and flavorful, about 20 minutes. You could do a proper duxelles but I can&#39;t be bothered."
- "While sauteeing the mushrooms and shallots, wilt the spinach or defrost it if it&#39;s frozen and give it a good squeeze of lemon juice to brighten it up (though don&#39;t get any pits in there or someone might lose a tooth)."
- "Remove the thyme sprigs and then spoon the mushroom mixture evenly into the center of the pork, along with the spinach. Using butcher&#39;s string, tie the pork shut, with ties about an inch or so apart (I use toothpicks and my girlfriend to help with this)."
- "In a bowl, mix together the breadcrumbs, Parmesan, and Italian spices. Then, moisten the crumbs with the olive oil and spread the mixture all over the pork."
- "Put your beautifully stuffed and artfully tied tenderloin in a suitable tray, bung in the preheated oven, and cook uncovered for 35 minutes or more (until a meat thermometer should read 165F/75C or no pink when cut). Be careful not to overcook or it will go dry."
- "Let it rest for 10 minutes, then slice and enjoy. And remember to cut off the twine."
