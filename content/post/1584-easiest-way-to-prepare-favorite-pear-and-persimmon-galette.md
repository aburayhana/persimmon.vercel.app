This is crazy because I grew up near Hashimoto Persimmon Farm and they have the BEST. Pretty darn good, whether on its own or served with a nip of brandy (we definitely recommend the latter). A galette is like a fruit pizza — thin and crispy crust and an even layer of lightly spiced fruit. It&#39;s less demanding than a pie — no crimped crust to fuss A surfeit of apples and a bag of pears.
