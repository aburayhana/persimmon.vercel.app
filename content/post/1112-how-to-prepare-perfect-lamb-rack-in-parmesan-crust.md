recipeingredient:
- "1 6bone Frenchtrimmed rack of lamb for two people"
- " salt and pepper"
- "1 tsp Dijon mustard"
- "1 tsp honey"
- "3-4 heaped tbsp grated parmesan"
- "1 tbsp breadcrumbs"
- "2-3 sprigs rosemary"
- " grated zest of 1 lemon"
recipeinstructions:
- "Score the skin on the lamb rack with a sharp knife on the diagonal. Mix the mustard with the honey and spread all over the lamb except bones."
- "Strip the leaves off the rosemary and chop really fine, almost to a powder. Grate lemon zest and the parmesan and whizz it with the rosemary and the breadcrumbs in a blender or food processor. You can just mix it all together in a bowl but whizzing breaks up the breadcrumbs and makes for a more uniform coating. Tip onto a shallow dish."
- "Dip the lamb rack in the herb and parmesan crumbs making sure the coating sticks well, press it on with your fingers."
- "Preheat the oven to 240C/475F/gas 9. Place the lamb rack on a baking tray, skin side up and roast for 10 minutes. Turn the heat down to 180C/350F/gas 4 and roast for further 20-25 minutes (roasting time after the initial 10 minute blast should be 15 minutes per pound, provided your lamb had been brought to room temperature). Let it rest in a warm place for at least 10 minutes."
